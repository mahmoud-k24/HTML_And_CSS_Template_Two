# The Second HTML & CSS Website Template - Kasper
This is my first HTML and CSS website template I've built.

The website template design is called *Kasper* and it's creative and great template for portfolio made by [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-creative-html-theme).

### Used to build the website:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
  * Flexbox
  * Grid
  * Media Queries
  * Variables
  * Pseudo Elements and Classes
* Libraries
  * Font Awesome Free 6.2.0
  * Normalize v8.0.1
  
The website is *Fully Responsive*.
